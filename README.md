# Introducing .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI)

.NET MAUI is:

* Multi-platform native UI
* Deploy to multiple devices across mobile & desktop
* Using a single project, single codebase
* Evolution of [Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin.forms)
* Targeting .NET 6, previews end of year

## Maui.sln

### SDKS required
- Install the SDKs listed here https://github.com/xamarin/net6-samples

- And/or run the following

```
dotnet tool install Cake.Tool -g
dotnet cake --target=provision
```

### Running

#### IDE
- If you have Visual Studio 16.9 P4 installed you can open `Maui.sln` and run it from there.

#### Command Line

```
dotnet build src\Platform.Handlers\samples\Sample.Droid\Sample.Droid-net6.csproj -t:Run
dotnet build src\Platform.Handlers\samples\Sample.iOS\Sample.iOS-net6.csproj -t:Run
```

## Status: Active Development

While [Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin.forms) continues to be actively supported through November 2022, we are making evolutionary changes based on customer research of what would be most beneficial. Current areas of focus are:

* Porting renderers to handlers ([spec](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/28))
* Adapting layouts for handlers
* WinUI 3 preview 3 early spike
* Mac Catalyst early evaluation

Active development is happening today to build Android and iOS SDKs against .NET 6. [Samples may be found here](https://github.com/xamarin/net6-samples).

### Goals

* Improve app performance
* Improve simplicity of control extensibility
* Improve simplicity of contributing
* Enable developer options to use Model-View-Update (MVU) and Blazor

### Roadmap

.NET MAUI and mobile SDK support will ship in concert with .NET 6. At present we do not have a shipping schedule for .NET 6.

### Milestones

* .NET MAUI previews Q4 2020 through Q3 2021
  * [Renderer architecture revisions](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/28)
  * Source solution and project simplification
  * Complete approved proposals
  * Implement MVU
* .NET MAUI release candidate September 2021
* .NET MAUI general availability November 2021

<sup>*</sup> The Windows implementation is expected to be WinUI 3, pending GA release. 

<sup>**</sup> These app models are experimental.

<sup>***</sup> Visual Studio Code will work by virtue of .NET unification, however not all experiences that make .NET MAUI development delightful (intellisense for example) may be enabled at the time of .NET 6 release.
