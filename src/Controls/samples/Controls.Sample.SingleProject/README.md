# .NET Maui "Single Project"

A "single project", is a multi-targeted .NET Maui project, such as:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworks>net6.0-android;net6.0-ios</TargetFrameworks>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <!-- Opts into the new project type -->
    <SingleProject>true</SingleProject>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Within the project you would have:

* `*.cs` all shared code
* `iOS/*` - iOS only stuff, including `Info.plist`
* `Android/*` - Android only stuff, including `AndroidManifest.xml`

This project type does not currently work well in IDEs.

To build, use the command-line:

```bash
$ dotnet build Maui.Controls.Sample.SingleProject.csproj
```

To run:

```bash
$ dotnet build Maui.Controls.Sample.SingleProject.csproj -t:Run -f net6.0-android --no-restore
```

Use `-f net6.0-android` or `-f net6.0-ios` to select your platform.

> NOTE: You need to add the `--no-restore` switch until
> [dotnet#15485][15485] is resolved.
