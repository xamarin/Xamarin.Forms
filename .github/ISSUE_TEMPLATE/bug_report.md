### Build Logs

<!--
If your issue is related to a build error, be sure to attach build logs.

Binary logs are preferred instead of text logs.  Please save and attach a .binlog if possible:
(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/obtaining-build-logs-with-msbuild?view=vs-2019#save-a-binary-log)

Otherwise, a text log is still helpful:

1. Place cursor below this comment block.
2. Attach build log or link to gist (https://gist.github.com/) of the log.
3. Logs can be found in the Build Output tab of the Errors pad in Visual Studio
To get full build logs, set the log verbosity to diagnostic at the following locations:
- On Visual Studio for Mac: Preferences > Projects > Build
- On Visual Studio for Windows: Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > Build and Run
On Visual Studio for Windows you also want to add `-v -v -v -v` to the mtouch additional arguments by right-clicking the project in the solution explorer and selecting `Properties`.
